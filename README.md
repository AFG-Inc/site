This is all of the code that is responsible for maintaining [our website](https://pythondiscord.com), and all of
its subdomains.

If you're looking to contribute or play around with the code, take a look at our 
[Project Guide](https://wiki.pythondiscord.com/wiki/contributing/project/site), hosted on the wiki you'll find
in this very repository.
