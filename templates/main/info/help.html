                    Much of this document is based on the sentiments expressed by Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen
                    in their essay, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>.
                    Please note that the essay is very long and may be considered rude by some. Additionally, the people
                    behind that essay are in no way affiliated with us - please do not bother them with your Python

                    Before you ask your question, there are a few things you can do to find an answer on your own.
                    Experienced developers will do the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the official documentation for whatever you're working with</li>
                    <li>Use a debugger to inspect your code</li>
                    <li><a href="#traceback">Examine the traceback</a> when your code raises an exception</li>
                    <li>Do some research online - for example, on Stack Overflow</li>
                    <li>Read the source code for whatever you're working with</li>
                    <li>Search the message history of the help channels</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Essentially, doing your research is the first step towards a solution to any problem. If your
                    problem isn't extremely general, we're going to be doing exactly these steps ourselves when you ask,
                    so doing the legwork beforehand saves everyone a lot of time.

                    If you're an absolute beginner, take a moment to step back from the problem.
                    Have you <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers">read a book or done a
                    tutorial</a>? There's a huge amount of resources out there, many of which are going to help you a lot more than
                    us answering the beginners' questions for you. If you're following a tutorial, book or course and
                    you don't understand something, then <strong>that</strong> is the correct time to ask a beginners'
                    question. Of course, we won't turn you away if you do have a beginners' question &mdash; by all
                    means,
                    come to us if you do have a problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you read the official documentation for the module or technology you're working with? The
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">official Python 3 docs</a> are a fantastic and valuable
                    resource, so if you're using a bundled module, your first port of call should be there. If you're
                    using a third-party library, often they will have some official documentation uploaded somewhere
                    &mdash;
                    try having a Google around, or take a look <a href="https://pypi.org">at PyPi</a> in case they've
                    linked it from there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can't find the documentation or you find it lacking, the next place to look is the source
                    code.
                    Grab a decent IDE (we recommend <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> Community)
                    and a coffee, download a copy of the project and open it up, and get to browsing!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're still confused, try searching the Internet for people that have already had the same
                    problem. Often, you won't be the only person to have encountered the issue you're dealing with - more often
                    than not, you'll find a GitLab ticket or a StackOverflow question along with a fix or answer to your
                    question already posted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If none of the above helps you or you're lost, scared and alone, feel free to continue on to the
                    Discord server. You can use the search feature (the <i class="fas fa-search"></i> at the top right) to check
                    whether someone else has asked your question recently, or just feel free to pick one of the help channels

                    When you're ready to ask a question, there's a few things you should have to hand before forming
                    a query.

                    <li>
                        A code example that illustrates your problem
                        <ul>
                            <li>If possible, make this a minimal example rather than an entire application</li>

                    <li>Details on how you attempted to solve the problem on your own</li>
                    <li>Full version information &mdash; for example, <em class="uk-text-primary">"Python 3.6.4 with
                        discord.py 1.0.0a"</em></li>
                    <li>The full traceback if your code raises an exception
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not curate the traceback as you may inadvertently exclude information crucial to
                            solving your issue</li>
                        </ul>

                <p>
                    Your question should be informative, but to the point. More importantly, how you phrase your
                    question
                    and how you address those that may help you is crucial. Courtesy never hurts, and please type
                    using correctly-spelled and grammatical language as far as you possibly can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you're inspecting a problem, don't be quick to assume that you've found a bug, or that your
                    approach is correct. While it helps to detail what exactly you're trying to do, you should also
                    be able to give us the bigger picture - describe the goal, not just the step. Describe the problem's
                    symptoms in chronological order - not your guesses as to their cause.

                    Programmers have a certain set of mannerisms. While we all try to be as courteous with our replies
                    as possible, occasionally it may seem as if a helper is annoyed or disinterested in your question.
                    This isn't personal - it's just part of our culture. Remember that the people you're asking for help
                    are humans and that they're here voluntarily, in their free time.

                    If you've asked a question and you're told to read the documentation or search the web, you should
                    do that. When this happens, it's often the case that the person responding has the information you need
                    open in their web browser and either thinks that it's very easy to find, or that you would learn
                    more from seeking out the source of the information yourself. If you've already done this, you should
                    tell us by including it in your question!

                    Much of what looks like rudeness within programming communities is not intended to be offensive and
                    it's often just a product of the down-to-earth, direct style of communication that is typical in
                    a community that is more concerned with solving problems than anything else. If you perceive
                    rudeness, try to react calmly. If a user really is acting out, then chances are that a member of staff will
                    call them out on it. If this doesn't happen, contact a member of staff directly and they will try
                    to clarify this with you.

                    It's okay to mess up. It happens to all of us. That said, if you mess up badly enough, it's likely
                    that you will be corrected there and then, in public and with a verbal scalpel. Take this as a
                    learning experience and don't let it get to you - this is a common and appropriate response in
                    many programming circles. Community standards do not maintain themselves - they're maintained by
                    people applying actively them, visibly, in public.

                    our time is limited, and watching a video or participating in a screen-sharing session means that we
                    have to focus on you, instead of being able to deal with other people while you're figuring out an
                    answer. If your problem is graphical and you can't adequately describe it without a visual, take a

                <p>
                    Usually, the first sign of trouble is that when you run your code, it raises an exception. For beginning
                    programmers, the traceback that's generated for the exception may feel overwhelming and discouraging
                    at first. However, in time, most developers start to appreciate the extensive information contained in
                    the traceback as it helps them track down the error in their code. So, don't panic and take a moment to
                    carefully review the information provided to you.
                </p>
                <p class="uk-text-lead">
                    Reading the traceback
                </p>
                <p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "my_python_file.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    spam = division(a=10, b=0)
  File "my_python_file.py", line 2, in division
    answer = a / b
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, the best strategy is to read the traceback from bottom to top. As you can see in the example
                    above, the last line of the traceback contains the actual exception that was raised by your code. In
                    this case, <code>ZeroDivisionError: division by zero</code>, clearly indicates the problem: We're trying
                    to divide by zero somewhere in our code and that obviously can't be right. However, while we now know
                    which exception was raised, we still need to trace the exception back to the error in our code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do so, we turn to the lines above the exception. Reading from bottom to top again, we first encounter
                    the line where the exception was raised: <code>answer = a / b</code>. Directly above it, we can
                    see that this line of code was <code>line 2</code> of the file <code>"my_python_file.py"</code> and that
                    it's in the scope of the function <code>division</code>. At this point, it's a good idea to inspect the
                    code referenced here to see if we can spot an obvious mistake:
                </p>
                <p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code>1| <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">division</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">):</span>
2|    <span class="n">answer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">b</span>
3|    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">answer</span></code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, there's no obvious mistake in the code at this point, although one thing we do see
                    here is that this function divides <code>a</code> by <code>b</code> and that the exception will only
                    occur if <code>b</code> is somehow assigned the numeric value <code>0</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keeping that observation in the back of our minds, we continue reading the traceback from bottom
                    to top. The next thing we encounter is <code>spam = division(a=10, b=0)</code> from <code>line 6</code>
                    of the file <code>"my_python_file.py"</code>. In this case, <code>&lt;module&gt;</code> tells us
                    that the code is in the global scope of that file. While it's already clear from the traceback what's
                    going wrong here, we're passing <code>b=0</code> to the function <code>division</code>, inspecting the
                    code shows us the same:
                </p>
                <p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code>5| <span class="n">spam</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">division</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
6| <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">spam</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have now traced back the exception to a line of code calling the division function with a
                    divisor of 0. Obviously, this is a simplified example, but the exact same steps apply to
                    more complex situations as well.

                </p>
                <p class="uk-text-lead">
                    The error is sometimes in the line before the line in the traceback
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, the actual error is in the line just before the one referenced in the traceback. This
                    usually happens when we've inadvertently omitted a character meant to close an expression, like a
                    brace, bracket, or parenthesis. For instance, the following snippet of code will generate a
                    traceback pointing at the line after the one in which we've missed the closing parenthesis:
                </p>
                <p>
 <pre class="code python literal-block"><code><span></span>1| <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>
2| <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;This is my first Python program!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
 <pre class="code python literal-block"><code>File "my_python_file.py", line 2
    print("This is my first Python program!")
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason this may happen is that Python allows for
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#implicit-line-joining">implicit
                    line continuation</a> and will only notice the error when the expression does not continue
                    as expected on the next line. So, it's always a good idea to also check the line before the one
                    mentioned in the traceback!

                        The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html">errors and exceptions</a> chapter
                        in the official tutorial gives an overview of errors and exceptions in Python. Besides explaining
                        what exceptions are, it also explains how to handle expected exceptions graciously to keep your
                        application from crashing when an expected exception is raised and how to define custom
                        exceptions specific to your application.

                <p>
                    If you encounter an exception specific to an external module or package, it's usually a good idea
                    to check the documentation of that package to see if the exception is documented. Another option
                    is to paste a part of the traceback, usually the last line, into your favorite search engine to see
                    if anyone else has encountered a similar problem. More often than not, you will be able to find a
                    solution to your problem this way.
